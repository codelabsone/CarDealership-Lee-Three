# CarDealership-Lee-Three
Lucas, Nicholas, Kayla, Jacob CarDealership

This is a Ruby program for searching, buying, and selling vehicles.

*** FILES ***

Our class and module files are:

    'cars.rb'
    'inventory.rb'
    'menu.rb'

Our driver/test file is:

    'dealership.rb'

Simply run 'ruby dealership.rb' in the working directory and you
can test it out for yourself.

*** NOTES AND CURRENT STATE ***

Currently we are not using Rails/API's/databases/any other form of
interactive data, so all 'vehicles' are hard-coded into our inventory
for testing.

Not all features are functional or accessible yet.
