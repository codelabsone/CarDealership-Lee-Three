********** Menu Module **********
    Menu is a module that launches the main menu system for customer
interaction with the current working inventory. It passes in only the listings
attribute (the array holding car objects) of the inventory class (inventory.rb).

    It is called as a typical module method would be called and accepts the
inventory. Example:

    */

    car1 = Cars.new(2014, "Toyota", "Rav4", "Red", 29000)

    test_inventory = Inventory.new
    test_inventory.list(car1)

    Menu.menu(test_inventory)

    */

    This menu system handles all user interaction with our inventory with that
one simple invocation.

## NOTE: As of 08/17/19 our 'purchase' and 'sell' features indicated within the
menu are not currently implemented.
